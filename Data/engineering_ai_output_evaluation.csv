ENG-007,power_systems,"Why does voltage drop occur in long transmission lines?",gpt-4,"Voltage drops because electricity weakens as it travels long distances.",incorrect,"conceptual_misunderstanding",3,"The explanation is incorrect and non-technical. Voltage drop occurs due to line resistance and current flow, not because electricity weakens over distance.","Explain voltage drop using line resistance, current, and Ohm’s law."
